# NLP-Word-Embeddings-RNN-LSTM
Extracting Word2Vec features from 60k Amazon reviews dataset to train GRU, LSTM, and RNN models.

This code deals ssing the Word2Vec features to train a feedforward multilayer perceptron network and recurrent neural networks for classification.
The word embeddings have been used for various models such as:
1. LSTM
2. GRU
3. Single level Perceptron
4. Feed-forward Neural Networks
5. Recurrent Neural Networks
